- Manager-focused review and approval workflow  
- Distance-based allowance calculations (straight-line, CHF per km)
- Bi-directional notification system
- Simple rejection-resubmission cycle

## Technique Sessions

### First Principles Thinking - 20 minutes

**Description:** Breaking down the travel allowance system to its fundamental building blocks

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Employee location data (home addresses)
2. Project data (name, subprojects, location of each subproject, cost per kilometer in Swiss francs)
3. Employee request capability (project, subproject, days per week)
4. Manager search and view functionality for employee requests
5. Manager approval capability for new requests
6. Employee notification system for approvals
7. Manager notification system for new requests
8. Rejection workflow with resubmission/withdrawal options
9. Straight-line distance calculation method

**Insights Discovered:**
- Distance calculation method needed clarification (straight-line chosen for simplicity)
- Complete request lifecycle emerged: Submit → Review → Approve/Reject → Notify → Resubmit/Withdraw
- Swiss Franc currency requirement indicates specific regional compliance needs

**Notable Connections:**
- Employee and manager workflows are perfectly complementary
- Notification system serves both user types but with different triggers
- Data requirements (employee addresses, project locations) directly support calculation engine

### Role Playing - 15 minutes  

**Description:** Exploring the system from Employee and Manager user perspectives

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Manager assignment (employee selects which manager reviews request)
2. Request status dashboard for employees
3. Approved travel allowance amount visibility
4. No reminder system needed (user preference)
5. Type-in manager name selection (simple text input)
6. Manager decision support information (calculated amounts, distances, employee totals)
7. Employee justification field for travel requests
8. Bulk approval capability for managers
9. Manager comment capability for rejections

**Insights Discovered:**
- Employees want transparency (status, amounts) but not automation (no reminders, no auto-approval)
- Managers need comprehensive information for decision-making but want control over process
- Simple UI approaches preferred (type-in vs. dropdown for manager selection)

**Notable Connections:**
- Employee desire for transparency aligns with manager need for information visibility
- Both roles value manual control over automated processes
- Request justification serves both employee expression and manager decision-making needs
