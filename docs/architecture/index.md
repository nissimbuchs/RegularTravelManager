## Navigation Tips

- **Start with 01-system-overview** for complete system understanding
- **Use 02-infrastructure-deployment** for deployment and configuration issues
- **Reference 03-data-architecture** for database and data modeling questions
- **Check 04-api-design** for API integration and workflow understanding
- **See 05-frontend-architecture** for Angular patterns and subscription management
- **Review 06-backend-architecture** for Lambda functions and technology choices

## Architecture Principles

This documentation structure follows these architectural principles:

üèóÔ∏è **Systems Thinking** - Every component understood in context of the larger system
üìö **Progressive Detail** - Information organized from high-level to implementation specifics  
üîÑ **Cross-Stack Integration** - Frontend, backend, and infrastructure concerns properly linked
‚ö° **Developer Experience** - Documentation structure optimizes for common development workflows
üõ°Ô∏è **Quality Assurance** - Critical patterns and requirements clearly highlighted and enforced
