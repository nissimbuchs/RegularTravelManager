# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: strict-dynamic with nonce
- XSS Prevention: Content sanitization, secure headers
- Secure Storage: JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: OpenAPI schema validation
- Rate Limiting: API Gateway throttling
- CORS Policy: Restricted origins only

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: Secure httpOnly cookies
- Session Management: Cognito refresh tokens
- Password Policy: AWS Cognito managed

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: <200KB initial load
- Loading Strategy: Code splitting, lazy loading
- Caching Strategy: Service worker for static assets

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: <500ms for API calls
- Database Optimization: Connection pooling, indexed queries
- Caching Strategy: ElastiCache for frequent lookups
