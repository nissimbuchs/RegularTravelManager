# Story 4.5: Data Export & Audit Compliance

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** business administrator,
**I want** comprehensive audit trails and data export capabilities,
**so that** I can meet compliance requirements, support financial reporting, and maintain proper business records.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Audit trail system logs all user actions including request submissions, approvals, modifications, and administrative changes
2. Comprehensive data export functionality generates reports for payroll integration, expense accounting, and compliance documentation
3. Audit log includes user identification, timestamps, IP addresses, and detailed action descriptions for security and compliance review
4. Financial reporting exports provide travel allowance data formatted for integration with accounting systems and payroll processing
5. Data retention policies automatically archive old requests while maintaining accessibility for audit and historical reporting needs
6. Compliance reporting generates standardized reports meeting Swiss business documentation and regulatory requirements
7. Data export formats include CSV, PDF, and JSON with proper data formatting and currency representation for downstream systems
