# Story 2.4B: Travel Request Submission Backend Correction

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system,
**I want** to support employee selection of any manager for travel request approval,
**so that** employees can submit requests to appropriate managers regardless of organizational hierarchy.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **CRITICAL FIX:** Modify travel request submission to accept `manager_id` from request body instead of defaulting to employee's assigned manager
2. Validate that selected `manager_id` corresponds to an active manager in the system
3. Maintain all existing calculation and persistence functionality unchanged
4. Update request validation to require `manager_id` in request body
5. Ensure submitted travel request stores the selected manager, not the employee's default manager
6. Provide clear error messaging when invalid manager selection is attempted

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Fix critical business logic in travel request creation (AC: 1,5)
  - [x] Modify `createTravelRequest` handler to accept `manager_id` from request body
  - [x] Remove automatic assignment of `employee.manager_id`
  - [x] Update request interface to include `manager_id` parameter
  - [x] Ensure persistence uses provided `manager_id` instead of employee's default
  - [x] Update request body validation to require `manager_id`

- [x] Add manager validation logic (AC: 2)
  - [x] Implement manager existence and active status validation
  - [x] Add validation query to confirm manager is active and valid
  - [x] Ensure manager has proper role permissions
  - [x] Add validation before travel request creation

- [x] Update request validation (AC: 4)
  - [x] Add `manager_id` to required fields validation
  - [x] Update request body parsing to include `manager_id`
  - [x] Update validation error messages
  - [x] Ensure backward compatibility with existing API structure

- [x] Enhance error handling (AC: 6)
  - [x] Add specific error messages for invalid manager selection
  - [x] Create user-friendly error responses for manager validation failures
  - [x] Add appropriate HTTP status codes for different validation failures
  - [x] Update error logging for better debugging

## Dev Notes

### Current Implementation Issue
The existing `createTravelRequest` function in `apps/api/src/handlers/employees/travel-requests.ts` has a **critical business logic flaw**:

**Lines 227-229:** 
```typescript
// PROBLEM: Uses employee.manager_id instead of allowing manager selection
await db.query(insertQuery, [
  employee.id,
  employee.manager_id, // ❌ WRONG: Forces employee's assigned manager
  subproject.project_id,
  // ...
]);
```

**Expected behavior:** Should accept `managerId` from request body (camelCase per API conventions) to allow employee choice.

### Required Changes

**Note:** Per the architecture's API field naming conventions, all API request/response bodies use camelCase (e.g., `managerId`, `subprojectId`), while database columns remain snake_case (e.g., `manager_id`, `subproject_id`). The backend handles the conversion between these formats.

#### 1. Request Body Interface Update
```typescript
// Current interface (missing managerId) - Using camelCase per API field naming conventions
const { subprojectId, daysPerWeek, justification } = body;

// Required interface (with managerId) - Using camelCase per API field naming conventions
const { subprojectId, daysPerWeek, justification, managerId } = body;
```

#### 2. Validation Update
```typescript
// Add managerId to required fields - Using camelCase per API field naming conventions
if (!subprojectId || !daysPerWeek || !justification || !managerId) {
  return {
    statusCode: 400,
    body: JSON.stringify({
      error: 'subprojectId, daysPerWeek, justification, and managerId are required',
    }),
  };
}
```

#### 3. Manager Validation Logic
```typescript
// Add manager validation before travel request creation
const managerQuery = `
  SELECT id, is_active
  FROM employees 
  WHERE cognito_user_id = $1 AND employee_id LIKE 'MGR-%' AND is_active = true
`;

const managerResult = await db.query(managerQuery, [managerId]);  // Using camelCase field

if (managerResult.rows.length === 0) {
  return {
    statusCode: 400,
    body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Invalid or inactive manager selected' }),
  };
}
```

#### 4. Persistence Fix
```typescript
// Use provided managerId instead of employee.manager_id (API uses camelCase, DB uses snake_case)
const insertResult = await db.query(insertQuery, [
  employee.id,
  managerResult.rows[0].id, // ✅ CORRECT: Use selected manager
  subproject.project_id,  // Note: DB field remains snake_case
  // ...
]);
```

### Dependencies
- **Story 2.4:** Travel Request Submission Form (requires manager dropdown)
- **Existing API:** `getManagers` endpoint already implemented
- **Database schema:** No changes required - `travel_requests.manager_id` field exists

### API Endpoints Affected
- **POST /travel-requests** - Requires modification for manager selection
- **GET /managers** - Already implemented and functional ✅

### Testing
- **Test Location:** 
  - Backend: `apps/api/src/__tests__/handlers/employees/`
  - Integration: Test with different manager selections
- **Test Standards:** 
  - Test manager validation with valid/invalid IDs
  - Test request submission with selected manager
  - Test error handling for invalid manager selections
- **Specific Requirements:**
  - Verify selected manager is stored in travel_requests table
  - Test validation prevents submission with inactive managers
  - Test error messages provide clear guidance
  - Verify existing calculation logic remains unchanged

- ❌ Creates inconsistent user experience

### Expected Resolution
After completion:
- ✅ Employees can select any active manager
- ✅ Frontend manager dropdown functions correctly
- ✅ Travel requests store selected manager
- ✅ Maintains all existing calculation functionality

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-03
