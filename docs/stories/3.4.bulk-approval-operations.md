# Story 3.4: Bulk Approval Operations

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** manager,
**I want** to select and approve multiple travel requests simultaneously with batch processing,
**so that** I can efficiently handle high volumes of requests during peak periods.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Multi-select functionality allows managers to select individual requests or entire pages with select-all checkbox
2. Bulk approval interface displays summary of selected requests with total allowance amounts and affected employees
3. Batch processing system handles large selections (50+ requests) with progress tracking and partial completion support
4. Validation system prevents bulk approval of requests requiring individual review (high amounts, unusual patterns)
5. Confirmation workflow shows impact summary and requires manager authentication before executing bulk operations
6. Processing results provide detailed feedback on successful approvals, failures, and warnings with individual request status
7. Rollback functionality allows managers to undo recent bulk operations within 10 minutes of execution
