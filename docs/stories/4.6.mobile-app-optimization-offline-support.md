# Story 4.6: Mobile App Optimization & Offline Support

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As an** employee,
**I want** optimized mobile experience with offline capability,
**so that** I can submit travel requests and check status while traveling without reliable internet connectivity.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Progressive Web App (PWA) implementation enables mobile app-like experience with home screen installation and native feel
2. Offline request drafting allows employees to prepare travel requests without internet connection using local storage
3. Background synchronization automatically submits offline requests and updates status when connectivity returns
4. Mobile-optimized forms with touch-friendly controls, appropriate keyboard types, and streamlined input workflows
5. Offline dashboard caching displays recently viewed requests and status information during connectivity interruptions
6. Push notification support for mobile devices alerts employees of status changes even when app is not active
7. Mobile performance optimization ensures fast loading and smooth interactions on slower mobile networks and devices
