# Story 3.5: Employee Search & History

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** manager,
**I want** to search for employees and view their complete travel request history with analytics,
**so that** I can understand patterns, make informed approval decisions, and identify policy compliance issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Employee search functionality provides autocomplete search by name, email, department, or employee ID with instant results
2. Employee profile view displays personal information, current role, manager hierarchy, and contact details
3. Request history timeline shows all travel requests with status, dates, projects, and allowance amounts in chronological order
4. Analytics dashboard presents spending patterns, approval rates, frequency trends, and comparison with peer employees
5. Filter capabilities allow viewing history by date ranges, project types, approval status, and allowance amounts
6. Export functionality enables downloading employee travel data as CSV or PDF reports for record-keeping
7. Privacy controls ensure managers only access employees within their management scope and authority

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
From the architecture document:
- **Search Engine:** PostgreSQL full-text search with indexing
- **Analytics:** Time-series data aggregation with efficient queries
- **Access Control:** Role-based authorization with manager hierarchy
- **Export Services:** Background processing for large dataset exports

### Manager Workflow Context
From brainstorming session and PRD:
- **Informed Decisions:** Historical context enables better approval decisions
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify unusual or non-compliant behavior
- **Team Management:** Understand team travel needs and budgets
- **Compliance Monitoring:** Ensure adherence to travel policies

### Business Requirements
From PRD requirements:
- **Employee Search:** Manager access to employee request history (FR4)
- **Analytics:** Spending patterns and trend analysis
- **Data Export:** Report generation for management and compliance
- **Privacy Compliance:** Appropriate data access controls

### Employee Search Data Model
```typescript
interface EmployeeSearchResult {
  id: string;
  employeeNumber: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  department: string;
  role: string;
  location: string;
  managerId: string;
  profilePhotoUrl?: string;
  isActive: boolean;
  lastRequestDate?: Date;
}

interface EmployeeProfile {
  personalInfo: PersonalInformation;
  employmentInfo: EmploymentInformation;
  travelSummary: TravelSummary;
  requestHistory: TravelRequestHistory[];
  analytics: EmployeeAnalytics;
}

interface EmployeeAnalytics {
  totalRequests: number;
  approvedRequests: number;
  rejectedRequests: number;
  totalAllowanceAmount: number;
  averageRequestAmount: number;
  requestFrequency: RequestFrequencyData;
  spendingTrends: SpendingTrendData[];
  peerComparison: PeerComparisonData;
}
```

### Search Performance Optimization
```sql
-- Database indexes for employee search performance
CREATE INDEX idx_employees_search ON employees 
USING gin(to_tsvector('english', first_name || ' ' || last_name || ' ' || email));

-- Note: Database indexes use snake_case column names per SQL conventions
-- API request/response bodies use camelCase per the architecture's field naming conventions
CREATE INDEX idx_employees_department ON employees (department);
CREATE INDEX idx_employees_manager ON employees (manager_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_requests_employee_date ON travel_requests (employee_id, submitted_date);
```

### Analytics Calculations
```typescript
interface SpendingAnalytics {
  monthlySpending: MonthlySpending[];
  yearOverYearGrowth: number;
  seasonalPatterns: SeasonalPattern[];
  projectDistribution: ProjectDistribution[];
  complianceScore: number;
}

interface PeerComparison {
  avgRequestsPerMonth: number;
  avgAllowancePerRequest: number;
  approvalRateComparison: number;
  departmentRanking: number;
  spendingPercentile: number;
}
```

### Privacy and Access Control
- **Manager Hierarchy:** Only access direct reports and their subordinates
- **Data Masking:** Sensitive personal information appropriately masked
- **Audit Logging:** All employee data access logged for compliance
- **GDPR Compliance:** Right to access and data portability support

### Performance Requirements
- **Search Response:** Employee search results within 200ms
- **Analytics Loading:** Dashboard load within 1 second
- **Export Processing:** Large reports generated within 30 seconds
- **Concurrent Access:** Support multiple managers searching simultaneously

### Testing

  - Frontend: apps/web/src/app/features/manager/components/__tests__/
  - Backend: apps/api/src/services/employee-search/__tests__/
  - Analytics: apps/api/src/services/analytics/__tests__/
- **Test Standards:** 
  - Search functionality testing with various query types
  - Analytics calculation testing with mock data
  - Privacy and access control testing
- **Testing Frameworks:** 
  - Frontend: Angular Testing Utilities with Jest
  - Backend: Node.js with Jest for search and analytics
  - E2E: Playwright for complete search workflow
- **Specific Requirements:**
