# Story 1.1: Project Setup & Repository Structure

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a properly configured monorepo with domain-driven design structure,
**so that** I can develop frontend and backend components with shared types and consistent tooling.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Monorepo created with npm workspaces containing `apps/`, `domains/`, `packages/`, and `infrastructure/` directories
2. TypeScript configuration shared across all workspaces with consistent compile targets and strict mode enabled  
3. ESLint and Prettier configurations standardized across all packages for code consistency
4. Package.json scripts configured for development (`dev`), building (`build`), and testing (`test`) across all workspaces
5. Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore for Node.js, TypeScript, and AWS CDK artifacts
6. README.md created with project overview, setup instructions, and development workflow guidance

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
From the architecture document (docs/architecture.md):
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo with Domain-Driven Design organization using npm workspaces
- **Domain-Centric Structure:** domains/ folder contains bounded contexts (travel-allowance, employee-management, project-management)
- **Technology Stack:** Angular 17+ frontend, Node.js Lambda backend, TypeScript throughout
- **Infrastructure:** AWS CDK in TypeScript for infrastructure-as-code

### Source Tree Structure
Based on architecture specifications:
```
RegularTravelManager/
├── domains/                     # Domain Layer (Business Logic)
│   ├── travel-allowance/        # Core Domain
│   ├── employee-management/     # Employee data domain  
│   └── project-management/      # Project and location domain
├── apps/                        # Application Layer
│   ├── web/                     # Angular Frontend
│   └── api/                     # Lambda Functions
├── packages/                    # Shared packages
│   ├── shared/                  # Shared types
│   └── ui/                      # UI components (if needed)
├── infrastructure/              # AWS CDK
└── docs/                        # Documentation
```

### Technical Requirements
- **Angular 17+** with Angular CLI for frontend build system
- **TypeScript 5.3+** with strict mode enabled across all workspaces
- **AWS CDK 2.100+** in TypeScript for infrastructure matching application language
- **Jest/Vitest** for testing framework
- **ESLint + Prettier** for code quality and formatting

### Testing
- **Test Location:** Each workspace should have its own `__tests__/` or `src/**/*.test.ts` files
- **Test Standards:** Use Jest or Vitest with TypeScript support
- **Testing Frameworks:** 
  - Frontend: Angular Testing Utilities with Jest
  - Backend: Vitest with Supertest for API testing
- **Coverage Requirements:** Aim for >80% test coverage across all workspaces

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The project setup and repository structure has been successfully implemented with high quality. All core infrastructure components are correctly configured including:

- Monorepo structure with npm workspaces
- TypeScript configuration with strict mode and composite projects
- ESLint and Prettier standardized across all packages
- Comprehensive build and development scripts
- Proper Git configuration with comprehensive .gitignore
- Detailed README with setup instructions and development guidelines

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `apps/web/tsconfig.json`
  - **Change**: Added `composite: true`, `declaration: true`, `declarationMap: true` and proper include/exclude configurations
  - **Why**: Required for TypeScript composite projects and proper workspace references
  - **How**: Enables incremental compilation and proper type checking across workspace boundaries

- **File**: `.eslintrc.js`
  - **Change**: Simplified TypeScript ESLint configuration and removed problematic project-based parsing
  - **Why**: The complex project reference configuration was causing parsing errors across workspace files
  - **How**: Uses simpler per-file TypeScript parsing that works correctly with monorepo structure

- **File**: `package.json`
  - **Change**: Added missing @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin dependency
  - **Why**: Required for TypeScript-specific linting rules
  - **How**: Enables proper TypeScript code analysis and unused variable detection

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ ESLint and Prettier configured with consistent rules
- Project Structure: ✓ Domain-driven design monorepo structure implemented correctly
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Test frameworks configured (Vitest for backend, Jest for Angular)
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed TypeScript compilation errors with composite project configuration
- [x] Fixed ESLint parsing errors across all workspace files
- [x] Verified all build scripts work correctly across workspaces
- [x] Confirmed all dependencies are properly declared and installed

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Proper .gitignore configuration prevents accidental exposure of sensitive files including environment variables, node_modules, and build artifacts.

### Performance Considerations

TypeScript composite projects and incremental compilation are properly configured for optimal build performance. Build system uses efficient bundling with esbuild for Lambda functions.

### Files Modified During Review

- `apps/web/tsconfig.json`: Added composite project configuration
- `.eslintrc.js`: Simplified TypeScript ESLint configuration
- `package.json`: Added missing TypeScript ESLint plugin dependency

*Please update File List to include these configuration fixes*
