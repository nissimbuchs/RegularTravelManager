# Story 2.7: Frontend Subscription Lifecycle Management

## Status
Done

**Implementation Summary:** Successfully implemented comprehensive Phase 1 & Phase 2 subscription lifecycle management to eliminate memory leaks and prevent unauthorized error messages during logout.

## Story
**As a** user (employee, manager, or admin),
**I want** all HTTP requests and subscriptions to be properly cleaned up when I log out,
**so that** I don't receive unauthorized error messages and the application maintains clean state after logout.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **AC1**: When a user logs out, all active HTTP subscriptions are immediately cancelled and cleaned up
2. **AC2**: No "unauthorized" or "forbidden" error messages appear after logout is complete
3. **AC3**: Background refresh calls and auto-refresh timers are properly stopped during logout
4. **AC4**: Component subscriptions use proper lifecycle management with `takeUntil(destroy$)` pattern
5. **AC5**: Service-level background operations are cancelled during authentication state changes
6. **AC6**: All subscription leaks are eliminated to prevent memory leaks and persistent HTTP requests
7. **AC7**: Error handling distinguishes between expected logout errors vs unexpected auth failures

## Dev Notes

### Technical Design Notes

**Problem Root Cause Analysis:**
Based on comprehensive code review, the issue stems from inconsistent subscription lifecycle management across the Angular frontend. Multiple components and services have subscriptions that persist after component destruction and continue executing after logout, causing "unauthorized" error floods.

**Critical Issues Identified:**
1. **TravelRequestFormComponent** - Several subscriptions missing `takeUntil(this.destroy$)` pattern
2. **ProjectService** - Background `refreshProjects()` calls lack lifecycle management
3. **ManagerDashboardService** - Auto-refresh timer not properly cleaned up during logout
4. **AuthInterceptor** - Processes requests even after logout instead of cancelling them

**Implementation Strategy - 3-Phase Approach:**

**Phase 1: Component-Level Fixes (Immediate Impact)**
- Fix subscription leaks in TravelRequestFormComponent by adding `takeUntil(this.destroy$)` to all HTTP subscriptions
- Update ProjectService to include destruction signals in background operations
- Integrate manager dashboard cleanup with auth service logout flow

**Phase 2: Service-Level Architecture (Systematic Cleanup)**
- Implement global subscription registry in AuthService for automatic cleanup
- Add request cancellation mechanism using AbortController
- Enhance error interceptor with context-aware error suppression

**Phase 3: Prevention & Monitoring (Long-term Maintenance)**
- Create subscription management utilities for consistent lifecycle handling
- Add development-time warnings for unmanaged subscriptions
- Implement request lifecycle debugging capabilities

**RxJS Patterns to Follow (from Architecture):**
```typescript
// Correct Pattern - All HTTP subscriptions must use this
private destroy$ = new Subject<void>();

ngOnInit(): void {
  this.service.getData()
    .pipe(takeUntil(this.destroy$))
    .subscribe(data => { /* handle data */ });
}

ngOnDestroy(): void {
  this.destroy$.next();
  this.destroy$.complete();
}
```

**State Management Integration:**
All services using BehaviorSubjects must implement proper cleanup during logout:
- Clear state subjects during logout
- Cancel pending HTTP requests
- Stop timer-based operations
- Notify dependent components of state reset

**Error Handling Strategy:**
- Distinguish between expected logout errors (401/403 after user.logout) vs unexpected auth failures
- Suppress error notifications for expected post-logout 401 errors
- Maintain error logging for debugging while preventing user-facing error floods

### Testing Standards

**Test File Locations:**
- Component tests: `apps/web/src/app/features/*/components/__tests__/*.spec.ts`
- Service tests: `apps/web/src/app/core/services/__tests__/*.spec.ts`
- Integration tests: `apps/web/src/app/__tests__/integration/*.spec.ts`

**Testing Framework:** Jest + Angular Testing Utilities

**Specific Testing Requirements:**
1. **Subscription Lifecycle Tests:**
   - Verify `takeUntil(destroy$)` pattern prevents memory leaks
   - Test component destruction cancels all active subscriptions
   - Validate service cleanup during logout

2. **Error Handling Tests:**
   - Test logout scenarios with active HTTP requests
   - Verify error suppression for expected auth failures
   - Validate error messages don't appear after successful logout

3. **Integration Tests:**
   - Test complete logout flow with multiple concurrent requests
   - Verify different user roles handle logout consistently
   - Test auto-refresh cleanup across different dashboard states

**Testing Patterns:**
```typescript
// Test subscription cleanup
it('should cancel all subscriptions on component destroy', () => {
  // Setup active subscriptions
  // Trigger component destroy
  // Verify no pending HTTP requests
  // Verify no memory leaks
});

// Test logout cleanup
it('should stop all background operations during logout', () => {
  // Setup background operations
  // Trigger logout
  // Verify all timers/intervals stopped
  // Verify no error notifications
});
```
