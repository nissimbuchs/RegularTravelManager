# Story 3.3: Email Notification System

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user (employee, manager, or admin),
**I want** to receive automated email notifications for travel request status changes and system events,
**so that** I stay informed about important updates without constantly checking the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Employee notifications include request submission confirmation, status updates (approved/rejected), and manager feedback with proper Swiss business email formatting
2. Manager notifications alert about new requests requiring approval, overdue reviews, and bulk processing summaries with actionable links
3. Email templates use professional Swiss business styling with company branding and clear call-to-action buttons
4. Notification preferences allow users to customize frequency (immediate, daily digest, weekly summary) and event types
5. Email delivery system handles failures gracefully with retry logic and fallback notifications via in-app messaging
6. Multi-language support provides notifications in German, French, and English based on user preferences
7. Email tracking system logs delivery status and provides delivery confirmation for critical notifications
