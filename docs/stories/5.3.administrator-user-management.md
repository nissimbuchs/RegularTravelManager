## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
From the architecture document:
- **Role-Based Access:** Extends existing Cognito user groups with administrative capabilities
- **Data Integrity:** Maintains referential integrity across user deletion and role changes
- **Audit Compliance:** Comprehensive administrative action logging for Swiss business compliance
- **Scalability:** Supports large user bases with efficient pagination and filtering

### Existing System Integration
From brainstorming session and current implementation:
- **Authentication System:** Leverages existing JWT validation with admin role checking
- **User Groups:** Integrates with existing Cognito user groups (employees, managers, administrators)
- **Travel Requests:** Handles cleanup and reassignment of travel requests during user management
- **Email System:** Uses existing SES configuration for administrative notifications

### Security Requirements
From PRD non-functional requirements:
- **Admin Authorization:** Strict role validation for all administrative operations (NFR14)
- **Data Encryption:** All admin operations via HTTPS/TLS (NFR6)
- **Audit Trail:** Comprehensive logging of all administrative actions (NFR12)
- **Access Control:** Fine-grained permissions for different admin operations (NFR7)
