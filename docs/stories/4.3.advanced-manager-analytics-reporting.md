# Story 4.3: Advanced Manager Analytics & Reporting

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** manager,
**I want** to view analytics about my approval patterns and team travel expenses,
**so that** I can identify trends, optimize approval processes, and manage travel budgets effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Manager analytics dashboard displays approval metrics including average processing time, approval rates, and volume trends
2. Team expense summary shows total approved allowances by time period (weekly, monthly, quarterly) with budget tracking capabilities
3. Employee expense analysis identifies high-frequency travelers, average allowances per employee, and cost center breakdowns
4. Project expense reporting shows travel costs by project and subproject with cost-per-kilometer utilization analysis
5. Approval pattern insights highlight peak submission times, common rejection reasons, and processing bottlenecks
6. Exportable reports in PDF and CSV formats for budget planning, compliance reporting, and management presentations
7. Configurable date ranges and filtering options allow managers to analyze specific time periods, projects, or employee groups
