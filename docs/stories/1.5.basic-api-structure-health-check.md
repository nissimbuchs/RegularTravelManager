# Story 1.5: Basic API Structure & Health Check

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** Lambda functions and API endpoints structured following DDD principles with a working health check,
**so that** I can validate the complete technology stack and have a foundation for business logic implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Lambda function handlers organized by domain (`travel-requests/`, `employees/`, `projects/`, `auth/`) in `apps/api/src/handlers/`
2. Shared middleware implemented for CORS, error handling, logging, and request validation
3. Domain service interfaces created in `domains/` workspace referencing business entities from brainstorming session
4. Health check endpoint (`GET /health`) implemented returning system status, database connectivity, and service versions
5. API client utilities created in `packages/shared` for TypeScript interface definitions
6. Error handling middleware returns consistent error format across all endpoints
7. Health check endpoint accessible through API Gateway and returns 200 status with proper JSON response
8. All Lambda functions deploy successfully and can be invoked through API Gateway without errors

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
From the architecture document (docs/architecture.md):
- **Backend Framework:** AWS Lambda + Fastify for minimal cold start overhead
- **API Style:** REST with OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- **Organization:** Domain-Driven Design with bounded contexts
- **Shared Types:** TypeScript interfaces in dedicated workspace package

### Domain Structure
Based on brainstorming session and architecture:
- **travel-allowance/:** Core domain with request submission and calculation logic
- **employee-management/:** Employee data and manager relationship management
- **project-management/:** Project and subproject data with geographic locations
- **Shared-kernel/:** Cross-domain shared concepts and utilities

### API Response Format
Consistent response format across all endpoints:
```typescript
// Success Response
{
  success: true,
  data: any,
  timestamp: string,
  requestId: string
}

// Error Response  
{
  success: false,
  error: {
    code: string,
    message: string,
    details?: Record<string, any>,
    timestamp: string,
    requestId: string
  }
}
```

### Health Check Response Format
```typescript
{
  status: "healthy" | "degraded" | "unhealthy",
  timestamp: string,
  version: string,
  services: {
    database: { status: string, responseTime: number },
    cognito: { status: string, responseTime: number },
    ses: { status: string, responseTime: number }
  }
}
```

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time:** Health check and all endpoints must support <500ms (NFR1)
- **CORS Configuration:** Proper CORS headers for Angular frontend (NFR5)
- **Logging:** Structured logging for debugging and monitoring (NFR12)
- **Error Handling:** Client-side and server-side validation (NFR5)

### Testing Requirements
- **Test Location:** apps/api/src/__tests__/ with domain-specific subdirectories

- **Testing Frameworks:** Vitest with Supertest for API endpoint testing
- **Specific Requirements:**
  - Test health check endpoint returns proper JSON format
  - Test CORS headers are correctly configured

  - Test Lambda deployment and API Gateway integration
  - Integration test complete request/response cycle

### Testing
- **Test Location:** apps/api/src/__tests__/handlers/ and apps/api/src/__tests__/middleware/
- **Test Standards:** Unit tests for individual handlers, integration tests for API flows
- **Testing Frameworks:** 
  - Vitest with Supertest for API endpoint testing
  - AWS Lambda testing utilities for handler testing
- **Specific Requirements:**
  - Test complete API request/response cycle through API Gateway
