# Story 2.5: Employee Request Dashboard

## Status
Done

## Story
**As an** employee,
**I want** to view all my travel requests with status and calculated amounts,
**so that** I can track request progress and see my approved allowances.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Dashboard displays all employee requests in a table with columns for project, subproject, status, submitted date, and allowance amounts
2. Status indicators use color coding (yellow for pending, green for approved, red for rejected) with clear visual hierarchy
3. Request details expandable to show full justification, manager assigned, distance calculation, and status history
4. Filter capabilities allow viewing requests by status (all, pending, approved, rejected) and date ranges
5. Approved requests clearly display daily allowance amount and weekly total with CHF formatting
6. Pagination or infinite scroll handles large numbers of requests efficiently
7. Dashboard updates automatically when request status changes without requiring page refresh

### Dashboard Data Model
```typescript
interface EmployeeDashboard {
  requests: TravelRequest[];
  totalRequests: number;
  pendingCount: number;
  approvedCount: number;
  rejectedCount: number;
  totalApprovedAllowance: number; // CHF monthly
}

interface TravelRequestSummary {
