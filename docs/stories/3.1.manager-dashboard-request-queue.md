# Story 3.1: Manager Dashboard & Request Queue

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** manager,
**I want** to view all pending travel requests assigned to me with employee context,
**so that** I can efficiently review and prioritize requests requiring my approval.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Manager dashboard displays pending requests in a prioritized table with columns for employee name, project, subproject, requested days, calculated allowance, and submission date
2. Employee context panel shows employee details, current total weekly allowances, and request history when selecting a request
3. Request filtering capabilities allow searching by employee name, project, date range, and allowance amount ranges
4. Sorting functionality enables ordering by submission date, allowance amount, employee name, or urgency indicators
5. Pagination handles large volumes of requests with configurable page sizes (10, 25, 50 requests per page)
6. Dashboard auto-refreshes every 2 minutes to show new requests without manual page refresh
7. Visual indicators highlight urgent requests or those approaching approval deadlines

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
From the architecture document:
- **Frontend:** Angular 17+ with manager-specific feature module
- **State Management:** NgRx for dashboard state and real-time updates
- **API Integration:** Manager-specific endpoints with role-based authorization
- **Real-time Updates:** Polling or WebSocket for new request notifications

### Manager Workflow Context
From brainstorming session and PRD:
- **Core Workflow:** Manager review → approval/rejection with context
- **Employee Context:** Critical for informed decision-making
- **Batch Processing:** Preparation for bulk approval operations (Story 3.4)
- **Performance:** Handle high volumes during peak submission periods

### Business Requirements
From PRD requirements:
- **Manager Search:** Search and view employee requests with filtering (FR4)
- **Employee Context:** Complete visibility for informed decisions
- **Role-based Access:** Manager-only dashboard with proper security (FR14)
- **Efficient Processing:** Support manager productivity and workflow

### Dashboard Data Model
```typescript
interface ManagerDashboard {
  pendingRequests: TravelRequestSummary[];
  totalPending: number;
  urgentCount: number;
  filters: DashboardFilters;
  employeeContext?: EmployeeContext;
}

interface TravelRequestSummary {
  id: string;
  employeeName: string;
  employeeEmail: string;
  projectName: string;
  subProjectName: string;
  daysPerWeek: number;
  calculatedAllowance: number;
  submittedDate: Date;
  urgencyLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  daysSinceSubmission: number;
}

interface EmployeeContext {
  employee: Employee;
  currentWeeklyAllowance: number;
  activeRequestsCount: number;
  recentHistory: TravelRequest[];
}
```

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time:** Dashboard load under 500ms (NFR1)
- **Concurrent Users:** Support 100 concurrent managers (NFR9)
- **Auto-refresh:** Efficient polling without impacting performance
- **Large Datasets:** Handle hundreds of pending requests efficiently

### Testing
- **Test Location:**
