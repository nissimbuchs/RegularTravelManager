## Dev Notes

### Technical Design Notes

**Component Translation Completion Strategy**:
This story completes the component translation work started in Story 7.1, focusing on the remaining 29 components across admin, manager, employee, profile, and shared areas using the established synchronous translation architecture.

**Synchronous Translation Architecture** [Aligns with docs/architecture/05-frontend-architecture.md]:
```typescript
// Template usage with synchronous translation service (CORRECT PATTERN)
<h1>{{ translationService.translateSync('admin.projects.title') }}</h1>
<input [placeholder]="translationService.translateSync('admin.projects.searchPlaceholder')">
<button>{{ translationService.translateSync('common.buttons.save') }}</button>

// Component usage with direct synchronous access
export class AdminProjectsComponent {
  constructor(public translationService: TranslationService) {} // PUBLIC injection required

  getPageTitle(): string {
    return this.translationService.translateSync('admin.projects.title');
  }

  showSuccessMessage(): void {
    const message = this.translationService.translateSync('admin.projects.messages.saved');
    this.snackBar.open(message, 'Close', { duration: 3000 });
  }
}
```

**Component Categories and Complexity**:
- **Authentication Components (3)**: Login, registration, email verification
- **Admin Components (11)**: Highest complexity with forms, dialogs, management interfaces
- **Manager Components (5)**: Medium complexity with dashboards and approval workflows
- **Employee Components (5)**: User-facing interfaces including travel request forms
- **Profile Components (1)**: Simple user profile management
- **Shared Components (5)**: Navigation, layout, confirmations, unauthorized, app component

**Total: 29 components requiring translation conversion**

**Integration with Story 7.1 Synchronous Foundation**:
- Uses existing TranslationService with synchronous translateSync() method
- Extends existing JSON translation files (de.json, fr.json, it.json, en.json)
- Uses synchronous method pattern: `{{ translationService.translateSync('key') }}`
- Maintains hierarchical key structure established in Story 7.1
- Eliminates async pipe complexity for static UI translations
- Provides immediate translation access without observable subscriptions

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Translation Implementation Best Practices (Lessons Learned from Task 2)

**1. Translation Key Structure Consistency**:
- **ALWAYS** use functional grouping pattern: `admin.users.dialogs.*` and `admin.projects.dialogs.*`
- **NEVER** use component-based grouping that creates inconsistencies
- Follow established hierarchy: `section.feature.context.type.specific_key`
- Example: `admin.projects.dialogs.form.fields.project_name` (✅ CORRECT)
- Example: `admin.project_form.fields.project_name` (❌ AVOID)

**2. ALL Language Files Must Be Updated Simultaneously**:
- **CRITICAL**: Every translation key added to `en.json` MUST be added to `de.json`, `fr.json`, and `it.json`
- Missing keys in any language file will cause runtime translation errors
- Use professional translations appropriate for Swiss business context
- Test with language switching to verify all keys exist in all languages

**3. Common Translation Keys Validation**:
- **ALWAYS** verify `common.*` section completeness before starting component conversion
- Required common keys include:
  - `common.buttons.*`: save, cancel, create, update, edit, delete, etc.
  - `common.values.*`: yes, no, true, false, etc.
  - `common.actions.*`: loading, saving, processing, etc.
  - `common.status.*`: active, inactive, pending, etc.
- Add missing common keys to ALL language files before component work

**4. Duplicate Translation Section Prevention**:
- **ALWAYS** search for existing translation sections before adding new ones
- Remove duplicate sections during implementation (e.g., standalone vs. nested sections)
- Use `grep -n "section_name" file.json` to find all occurrences
- Maintain single source of truth for each translation hierarchy

**5. Component Translation Pattern Verification**:
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Public service injection for template access
export class ComponentName {
  constructor(public translationService: TranslationService) {}
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Template usage
{{ translationService.translateSync('admin.section.key') }}

// ✅ CORRECT: TypeScript usage with parameter interpolation
this.translationService.translateSync('message.key', { param: value })

// ❌ INCORRECT: Private injection prevents template access
constructor(private translationService: TranslationService) {}
```

**6. Build Validation After Translation Changes**:
- **ALWAYS** run `npm run build:frontend` after adding translation keys
- Fix compilation errors immediately - they indicate missing or incorrect keys
- Verify no console errors about missing translation keys in browser
- Test language switching functionality with actual UI interaction

**7. Translation Key Discovery Strategy**:
- Use `grep -n "translationService.translateSync" component.ts` to find all required keys
- Cross-reference component usage with available translation keys
- Check for hardcoded strings that need translation conversion
- Verify dynamic message construction uses parameter interpolation correctly

### Testing Standards

**Testing Framework and Patterns**:
- **Framework**: Jest + Angular Testing Utilities for unit tests
- **Component Testing**: Focus on synchronous translation integration and language switching
- **Integration Testing**: Full user workflow testing across all languages

**Testing Requirements for Component Translation**:
- **Language Switching**: Test each component with all 4 languages
- **Key Coverage**: Verify all hardcoded text has been replaced
- **User Workflow**: Test complete user journeys (admin, manager, employee)
- **Error Handling**: Test error messages and edge cases are translated
- **Performance**: Ensure translation loading doesn't impact component performance

**Synchronous Testing Patterns**:
- Mock TranslationService.translateSync() method for component testing
- Test direct synchronous translation calls without observable complexity
- Test language switching with immediate UI updates via synchronous method calls
- Component testing with Angular Testing Library patterns for synchronous UI validation
- No async pipe testing required - direct method call testing only
