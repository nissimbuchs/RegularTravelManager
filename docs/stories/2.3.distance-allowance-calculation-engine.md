# Story 2.3: Distance and Allowance Calculation Engine

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** system,
**I want** to automatically calculate straight-line distances and daily allowances,
**so that** employees receive immediate, accurate cost estimates for their travel requests.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. PostGIS ST_Distance function calculates straight-line distance between employee home and subproject location in kilometers
2. Daily allowance calculation multiplies distance by subproject cost-per-kilometer rate with proper CHF decimal precision
3. Calculation engine handles edge cases including zero distance, missing coordinates, and invalid geographic data
4. Distance calculations cached for identical home-subproject combinations to improve performance
5. All calculations maintain 3 decimal places for distance and 2 decimal places for CHF amounts
6. Calculation audit trail stores original values for historical accuracy and compliance
7. Error handling provides meaningful messages when calculations cannot be performed

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
From the architecture document:
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension for geographic calculations
- **Caching:** Amazon ElastiCache Redis for calculation performance
- **Geographic Functions:** PostGIS ST_Distance for accurate distance calculations
- **Precision:** Swiss financial standards for CHF calculations

### Calculation Requirements
From PRD requirements:
- **Distance Method:** Straight-line (PostGIS ST_Distance) calculations (FR2)
- **Currency:** Swiss Francs with proper decimal precision (FR15)
- **Precision:** 3 decimal places for distance, 2 for currency (NFR8)
- **Performance:** Support <500ms API response times (NFR1)

### Database Function Implementation
PostGIS calculation function from architecture:
```sql
-- Distance calculation function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_travel_distance(
    employee_location GEOMETRY,
    project_location GEOMETRY
) RETURNS DECIMAL(10,3) AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN ST_Distance(
        employee_location::geography, 
        project_location::geography
    ) / 1000.0;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql IMMUTABLE;
```

### Calculation Logic
- **Daily Allowance** = Distance (km) × Cost per km rate (CHF)

  - Database: apps/api/src/__tests__/database/functions/
- **Test Standards:** 
  - Unit tests for calculation logic
