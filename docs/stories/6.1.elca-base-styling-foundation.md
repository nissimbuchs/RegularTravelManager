# Story 6.1: ELCA Base Styling Foundation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a structured ELCA-compliant styling architecture with separate SCSS files,
**so that** all components can consistently use ELCA branding guidelines and maintain separation between styling and component logic.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Base SCSS Architecture**: Create organized SCSS file structure with ELCA variables, mixins, and base styles
2. **ELCA Theme Integration**: Implement ELCA coral-red color system with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
3. **Angular Material Customization**: Configure Angular Material theme to use ELCA branding guidelines
4. **Component Style Separation**: Refactor existing component CSS files to use SCSS and import base ELCA styles
5. **Build Integration**: Ensure SCSS compilation works with Angular build system
6. **Style Documentation**: Document ELCA styling architecture and usage patterns for developers

## Dev Notes

### Technical Design Notes

**ELCA Styling Architecture Pattern:**
The implementation follows Angular best practices with SCSS modular architecture. Based on the UX Development Specifications [Source: docs/ux-development-specifications.md#design-system-implementation], the ELCA color system uses coral-red (#e74c3c) as the primary brand color with WCAG 2.1 AA compliant contrast ratios.

**Current State Analysis:**
The existing frontend uses basic CSS files with Angular Material indigo-pink theme and Swiss Professional color palette variables. The styling needs to be refactored to implement the documented ELCA guidelines from the UX specifications.

**SCSS Architecture Structure:**
```
src/styles/
├── base/
│   ├── _elca-variables.scss    # ELCA colors, fonts, spacing
│   ├── _elca-mixins.scss       # Reusable ELCA styling patterns
│   └── _elca-base.scss         # Base styles, resets, typography
├── components/
│   ├── _buttons.scss           # Button styles following ELCA
│   ├── _forms.scss             # Form styles following ELCA
│   └── _cards.scss             # Card styles following ELCA
├── themes/
│   └── _elca-material-theme.scss # Angular Material theme customization
└── main.scss                   # Import everything
```

**Angular Material Integration:**
The Angular Material theme needs to be customized to use ELCA branding. Current `styles.css` imports `@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css` which must be replaced with custom ELCA theme configuration.

**Component Refactoring Strategy:**
Each existing `.css` file will be converted to `.scss` and refactored to:
1. Import ELCA base variables and mixins
2. Remove hardcoded colors and replace with ELCA variables
3. Utilize ELCA mixins for common patterns
4. Maintain existing responsive behavior

**File Location References [Source: docs/architecture/05-frontend-architecture.md]:**
- Component styles: `apps/web/src/app/features/[module]/components/[component].scss`
- Global styles: `apps/web/src/styles/`
- Shared styles: `apps/web/src/styles/components/`

**Build System Integration:**
Angular CLI supports SCSS out-of-the-box. The `angular.json` configuration may need updates to ensure proper SCSS compilation and optimization during build process.

### Testing

**Testing Requirements [Source: docs/architecture/07-development-standards.md#testing-strategy]:**

**Frontend Testing Focus:**
- **Component Visual Testing**: Verify all existing components render correctly with new ELCA styling
- **Responsive Testing**: Test responsive design behavior with new SCSS architecture
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test SCSS compilation and styling across target browsers
- **Accessibility Testing**: Validate WCAG 2.1 AA contrast compliance with ELCA color system

**Build Testing:**
- **Development Build**: Verify `npm run dev:web` works with SCSS
- **Production Build**: Verify `npm run build` optimizes SCSS correctly
- **Bundle Analysis**: Ensure SCSS doesn't significantly increase bundle size

**Testing Approach:**
- Manual testing of existing components after style refactoring
- Automated accessibility testing tools for contrast validation
- Build system verification in both development and production modes

**No Unit Tests Required:**
This story focuses on styling architecture refactoring. No new business logic is introduced that requires unit testing.
