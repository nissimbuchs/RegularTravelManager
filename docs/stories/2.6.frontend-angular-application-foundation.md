# Story 2.6: Frontend Angular Application Foundation

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a responsive Angular application with authentication and role-based navigation,
**so that** I can access employee features securely across desktop and mobile devices.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Angular application created with TypeScript, Angular CLI build system, and Angular Material component library
2. Authentication flow integrates with Cognito for login, logout, and token refresh functionality
3. Role-based routing redirects employees to appropriate dashboard and restricts manager-only features
4. Responsive design works correctly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes with touch-friendly interfaces
5. Navigation component provides clear indication of current user role and available features
6. Loading states and error boundaries provide smooth user experience during API calls and failures
7. Application deployed and accessible through CloudFront CDN with proper HTTPS configuration

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
From the architecture document:
- **Frontend Framework:** Angular 17+ with TypeScript and Angular Material
- **Build System:** Angular CLI with esbuild bundling for optimal performance
- **Deployment:** S3 + CloudFront CDN for global distribution
- **Authentication:** AWS Cognito integration with JWT token management

### UX Requirements
From UX specifications:
- **Swiss Business Professional:** Clean, minimalist design with precision focus
- **Mobile-First:** Responsive design with touch-friendly interfaces (NFR3)
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for Swiss business users
- **Performance:** Frontend bundle size under 200KB for initial load (NFR10)

### Authentication Architecture
From the architecture document:
```typescript
// Angular Auth Service pattern
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class AuthService {
  private currentUserSubject = new BehaviorSubject<User | null>(null);
  public currentUser$ = this.currentUserSubject.asObservable();
  public isAuthenticated$ = this.currentUser$.pipe(map(user => !!user));

  login(credentials: LoginCredentials): Observable<AuthResponse>;
  logout(): Observable<void>;
  refreshToken(): Observable<string>;
  getCurrentUser(): Observable<User | null>;
}
```

### Role-Based Routing Structure
```typescript
// Route configuration with role guards
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'login', component: LoginComponent },
  { 
    path: 'employee', 
    canActivate: [AuthGuard, EmployeeGuard],
    loadChildren: () => import('./features/employee/employee.module').then(m => m.EmployeeModule)
  },
  { 
    path: 'manager', 
    canActivate: [AuthGuard, ManagerGuard],
    loadChildren: () => import('./features/manager/manager.module').then(m => m.ManagerModule)
  }
];
```

### Performance Requirements
- **Bundle Size:** Initial load under 200KB (NFR10)
- **Response Time:** Support <500ms API integration (NFR1)
- **Mobile Performance:** Touch-friendly interfaces with smooth interactions
- **CDN Performance:** Global distribution via CloudFront

### Security Requirements
- **HTTPS:** All communication encrypted (NFR6)
- **JWT Security:** Proper token handling and refresh (NFR7)
- **Role Security:** Strict role-based access control (FR14)
- **CORS:** Proper cross-origin resource sharing configuration
