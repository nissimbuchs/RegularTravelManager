# Story 3.6: Manager Role Authentication & Access Control

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** to implement secure manager role authentication and granular access controls,
**so that** only authorized managers can access approval workflows and employee data within their scope.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Manager role verification integrates with AWS Cognito user groups and validates manager permissions on each request
2. Hierarchical access control ensures managers only view and approve requests from their direct and indirect reports
3. Session management provides secure authentication with automatic timeout and re-authentication for sensitive operations
4. Permission system implements granular controls for different manager levels (team lead, department head, senior manager)
5. Audit logging tracks all manager actions including logins, approvals, data access, and configuration changes
6. Emergency access procedures allow temporary elevation of permissions with proper approval and audit trails
7. Multi-factor authentication requirement for manager accounts with high-privilege operations and bulk approvals

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
From the architecture document:
- **Authentication:** AWS Cognito with JWT tokens and user groups
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control with hierarchical validation
- **Audit:** CloudTrail integration for comprehensive logging
- **Security:** Multi-layer security with defense in depth

### Security Requirements
From PRD requirements:
- **Manager Authentication:** Secure access to approval workflows (FR14)
- **Data Protection:** Employee data access limited to authorized managers
- **Audit Compliance:** Complete tracking of all manager actions (FR12)
- **Swiss Privacy:** GDPR compliance and data residency requirements

### Role-Based Access Control Data Model
```typescript
interface ManagerRole {
  id: string;
  cognitoGroupName: string;
  name: string;
  level: 'team_lead' | 'department_head' | 'senior_manager' | 'executive';
  permissions: Permission[];
  hierarchyLevel: number;
  canDelegate: boolean;
}

interface Permission {
  resource: string; // 'requests', 'employees', 'analytics', 'bulk_operations'
  actions: string[]; // 'view', 'approve', 'reject', 'modify', 'export'
  constraints?: AccessConstraint[];
}

interface AccessConstraint {
  type: 'department' | 'budget_limit' | 'request_count' | 'time_window';
  value: string | number;
}

interface ManagerHierarchy {
  managerId: string;
  directReports: string[];
  indirectReports: string[];
  department: string;
  accessibleDepartments: string[];
  budgetAuthority: number;
}
```

### Authentication Flow
```typescript
interface AuthenticationFlow {
  // 1. Initial authentication
  cognitoLogin: (credentials) => Promise<CognitoTokens>;
  
  // 2. Role validation
  validateManagerRole: (token: string) => Promise<ManagerRole>;
  
  // 3. Permission check
  checkPermission: (managerId: string, resource: string, action: string) => Promise<boolean>;
  
  // 4. Hierarchical validation
  validateAccessScope: (managerId: string, targetEmployeeId: string) => Promise<boolean>;
}
```

### Audit Event Types
```typescript
enum AuditEventType {
  // Authentication events
  MANAGER_LOGIN = 'manager_login',
  MANAGER_LOGOUT = 'manager_logout',
  SESSION_TIMEOUT = 'session_timeout',
  MFA_CHALLENGE = 'mfa_challenge',
  
  // Authorization events
  PERMISSION_GRANTED = 'permission_granted',
  PERMISSION_DENIED = 'permission_denied',
  ROLE_CHANGE = 'role_change',
  
  // Business events
  REQUEST_VIEWED = 'request_viewed',
  REQUEST_APPROVED = 'request_approved',
  REQUEST_REJECTED = 'request_rejected',
  BULK_OPERATION = 'bulk_operation',
  EMPLOYEE_DATA_ACCESSED = 'employee_data_accessed',
  REPORT_EXPORTED = 'report_exported'
}

interface AuditEvent {
  id: string;
  eventType: AuditEventType;
  managerId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  resourceId?: string;
  resourceType?: string;
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
  success: boolean;
  details: Record<string, any>;
  riskScore: number;
}
```

### Security Configuration
```typescript
interface SecurityConfig {
  session: {
    timeoutMinutes: 30;
    extendOnActivity: true;
    maxConcurrentSessions: 3;
  };
  
  mfa: {
    requiredForRoles: ['department_head', 'senior_manager', 'executive'];
    requiredForOperations: ['bulk_approve', 'emergency_access'];
    gracePeriodDays: 7;
  };
  
  permissions: {
    cacheTTL: 300; // 5 minutes
    hierarchyRefreshInterval: 3600; // 1 hour
    emergencyAccessDuration: 240; // 4 hours
  };
}
```

### Performance Requirements
- **Authentication:** Login process within 2 seconds
