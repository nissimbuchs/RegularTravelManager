# Story 4.1: Request Status Tracking System

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user (employee or manager),
**I want** to track travel request status in real-time with detailed progress indicators and history,
**so that** I understand exactly where each request stands in the approval workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Real-time status updates display current request state (submitted, under review, approved, rejected) with timestamp information
2. Progress indicator shows workflow stages with visual completion status and estimated time remaining for each stage
3. Status history timeline presents complete audit trail of all status changes with manager names and timestamps
4. Automated notifications alert users when status changes occur via email and in-app notifications
5. Request details page shows current assignee, processing queue position, and expected resolution timeframe
6. Status filtering allows users to view requests by current status with saved filter preferences
7. Mobile-responsive status tracking works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
From the architecture document:
- **Real-time Updates:** WebSocket integration for live status broadcasting
- **State Management:** NgRx for complex status state and caching
- **Mobile Support:** Progressive Web App capabilities for mobile access
- **Performance:** Efficient data loading and caching strategies

### Business Requirements
From PRD requirements:
- **Status Transparency:** Complete visibility into request lifecycle (FR9)
- **Real-time Updates:** Immediate notification of status changes
- **Mobile Access:** Full functionality across all device types (NFR3)
- **Audit Trail:** Complete tracking of all status changes (FR12)

### Request Status Data Model
```typescript
enum RequestStatus {
  DRAFT = 'draft',
  SUBMITTED = 'submitted',
  UNDER_REVIEW = 'under_review',
  ADDITIONAL_INFO_REQUIRED = 'additional_info_required',
  APPROVED = 'approved',
  REJECTED = 'rejected',
  WITHDRAWN = 'withdrawn',
  EXPIRED = 'expired'
}

interface RequestStatusUpdate {
  id: string;
  requestId: string;
  previousStatus: RequestStatus;
  newStatus: RequestStatus;
  timestamp: Date;
  updatedBy: string;
  updatedByRole: string;
  comment?: string;
  metadata: StatusUpdateMetadata;
}

interface StatusProgress {
  currentStage: WorkflowStage;
  completedStages: WorkflowStage[];
  remainingStages: WorkflowStage[];
  overallProgress: number; // 0-100%
  estimatedCompletionTime?: Date;
  isDelayed: boolean;
  delayReason?: string;
}

interface WorkflowStage {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  order: number;
  isCompleted: boolean;
  completedAt?: Date;
  assignee?: string;
  estimatedDuration: number; // minutes
}
```

### Real-time Status Broadcasting
```typescript
interface StatusBroadcastEvent {
  type: 'status_change' | 'assignment_change' | 'comment_added';
  requestId: string;
  employeeId: string;
  managerId: string;
  data: any;
  timestamp: Date;
}

// WebSocket event handling
class StatusUpdateService {
  private ws: WebSocket;
  
  subscribeToRequest(requestId: string): Observable<StatusBroadcastEvent> {
    return this.socketService.listen(`request:${requestId}`);
  }
  
  broadcastStatusChange(update: RequestStatusUpdate): void {
    this.ws.send(JSON.stringify({
      event: 'status_change',
      requestId: update.requestId,
      data: update
    }));
  }
}
```

### Status Processing SLA Targets
```typescript
interface StatusSLA {
  status: RequestStatus;
  targetProcessingTime: number; // hours
  escalationTrigger: number; // hours
  businessHoursOnly: boolean;
}

const statusSLAs: StatusSLA[] = [
  {
    status: RequestStatus.SUBMITTED,
    targetProcessingTime: 24,
    escalationTrigger: 48,
    businessHoursOnly: true
  },
  {
    status: RequestStatus.UNDER_REVIEW,
    targetProcessingTime: 72,
    escalationTrigger: 120,
    businessHoursOnly: true
  }
];
```

### Mobile-Specific Features
- **Offline Caching:** Cache recent status updates for offline viewing
- **Push Notifications:** Native mobile push notifications for status changes
- **Touch Gestures:** Swipe to refresh, pull to load more status history
- **Adaptive UI:** Different layouts optimized for phone vs tablet screens
