# Story 1.7: Comprehensive Sample Data & Admin User Management

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** developer and administrator,
**I want** comprehensive, identical sample data sets in both LocalStack and AWS dev environments with admin user functionality,
**so that** I can develop and test consistently across environments while having administrative capabilities for project and user management.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Comprehensive sample data** created including realistic Swiss employees, managers, admin users, projects, subprojects, and travel requests with proper geographic coordinates
2. **Identical data loading** scripts ensure LocalStack and AWS dev environments contain exactly the same test data for consistent development experience
3. **Admin user role** implemented in Cognito with 'administrators' group having elevated privileges for system management
4. **Geographic test coverage** includes various Swiss cities (Zurich, Geneva, Basel, Bern) with accurate coordinates for distance calculation testing  
5. **Complete request lifecycle data** includes sample requests in all statuses (pending, approved, rejected, withdrawn) with proper audit trails
6. **Admin interface foundations** provide basic administrative capabilities for managing projects, subprojects, and user roles
7. **Data validation scripts** verify data integrity, proper relationships, and geographic calculation accuracy across both environments
8. **Environment consistency verification** automated checks ensure LocalStack and AWS dev maintain identical sample datasets

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Building on database schema from Story 1.3, this story provides the comprehensive sample data and admin functionality needed for complete development and testing scenarios.

### Data Models
From [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
- **Employee**: id, email, firstName, lastName, homeAddress, managerId, isActive
- **Project**: id, name, description, isActive, defaultCostPerKm  
- **SubProject**: id, projectId, name, location, costPerKm, isActive
- **TravelRequest**: Complete request lifecycle with status tracking and audit trails
- **Address**: Swiss address format with latitude/longitude coordinates
- **RequestStatus**: PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED, WITHDRAWN enum values

### API Specifications  
Admin-specific endpoints to be added to existing API structure:
- **Admin User Management**: GET/PUT /admin/users, role management
- **Admin Project Management**: POST/PUT/DELETE /admin/projects and /admin/subprojects
- **Admin Analytics**: GET /admin/analytics for system-wide reporting

### Database Schema Context
From [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]:
- **PostGIS Integration**: Geographic calculations using ST_Distance function
- **Audit Tables**: employee_address_history, request_status_history for complete tracking
- **Swiss Geographic Data**: Realistic coordinates for major Swiss cities
- **Data Constraints**: Proper CHECK constraints and foreign key relationships

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- **Sample Data Scripts**: `infrastructure/data/sample-data.sql`
- **Data Loading Scripts**: `localstack/init/03-load-sample-data.sh`  
- **Admin Components**: `apps/web/src/app/admin/` directory
- **Admin API Handlers**: `apps/api/src/handlers/admin/` directory
- **Data Validation**: `scripts/validate-sample-data.ts`

### Testing Standards

#### Testing
From [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- **Test Environment**: LocalStack container setup with sample data loading
- **Integration Tests**: Verify data loading in both LocalStack and AWS environments
- **Data Validation Tests**: Ensure geographic calculations and relationships are correct
- **Admin Function Tests**: Verify admin role permissions and administrative operations
- **Cross-Environment Tests**: Validate identical data sets between LocalStack and AWS dev

**Test File Locations:**
- `apps/api/src/__tests__/admin/` - Admin API endpoint tests
- `apps/web/src/app/admin/__tests__/` - Admin interface component tests  
- `scripts/__tests__/sample-data.test.ts` - Data loading and validation tests

### Technical Constraints
- **Swiss Geography**: All coordinates must be accurate Swiss locations for realistic distance calculations
- **CHF Currency**: All cost rates and allowances in Swiss Franc format with proper decimal precision
- **Environment Parity**: 100% identical data between LocalStack and AWS dev for consistent testing
- **Admin Security**: Proper role-based access control with Cognito group membership validation
