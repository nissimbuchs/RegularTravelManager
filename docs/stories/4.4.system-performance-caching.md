# Story 4.4: System Performance & Caching

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user (employee, manager, or admin),
**I want** fast, responsive application performance with efficient data loading,
**so that** I can complete tasks quickly without waiting for slow system responses.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Database query optimization with proper indexing reduces average response times to under 200ms for common operations
2. Redis caching layer stores frequently accessed data including employee profiles, project lists, and calculation results
3. Frontend performance optimization includes code splitting, lazy loading, and component memoization for sub-2-second page loads
4. API response caching for relatively static data (projects, employee lists) with appropriate cache invalidation strategies
5. Database connection pooling handles concurrent Lambda executions efficiently without connection exhaustion
6. Geographic calculation caching stores distance results for identical home-subproject combinations to avoid recalculation
7. Performance monitoring dashboard tracks key metrics including API response times, database query performance, and frontend rendering speed
