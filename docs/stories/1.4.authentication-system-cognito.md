# Story 1.4: Authentication System with Cognito

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** AWS Cognito authentication integrated with role-based access control,
**so that** employees and managers can securely log in with appropriate permissions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Cognito User Pool configured with email-based authentication and password policies meeting business security requirements
2. User groups created for 'employees' and 'managers' with appropriate group membership management
3. JWT token validation implemented in Lambda authorizer function with proper error handling
4. Lambda authorizer returns user context including sub, email, and role information for downstream functions
5. API Gateway configured to use Lambda authorizer for all protected routes
6. Test users created in both employee and manager groups with verified email addresses
7. Authentication flow tested end-to-end from login through API access with proper authorization

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
From the architecture document (docs/architecture.md):
- **Authentication:** Amazon Cognito User Pools with JWT tokens
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control with employee/manager groups
- **Security:** JWT tokens with proper expiration and refresh (NFR7)
- **Integration:** Lambda authorizer with API Gateway for protected routes

### Security Requirements
From PRD requirements:
- **Role Distinction:** Authentication system distinguishes between employee and manager roles (FR14)
- **HTTPS/TLS:** All authentication must use encrypted transmission (NFR6)
- **JWT Security:** Tokens must expire and refresh according to security best practices (NFR7)
- **Access Control:** Appropriate permissions for different user roles

### Angular Frontend Integration
From the architecture document:
- **Angular Auth Service:** Service-based authentication with JWT token management
- **Auth Guards:** Route protection using Angular guards
- **HTTP Interceptors:** Automatic token inclusion and error handling
- **User Context:** Reactive user state management with role-based UI

### Lambda Authorizer Pattern
```typescript
// Expected authorizer response format
{
  principalId: payload.sub,
  policyDocument: {
    Version: '2012-10-17',
    Statement: [{
      Action: 'execute-api:Invoke',
      Effect: 'Allow',
      Resource: event.methodArn
    }]
  },
  context: {
    sub: payload.sub,
    email: payload.email,
    isManager: payload['cognito:groups']?.includes('managers') || false
  }
}
```

### Testing Requirements
- **Test Location:** apps/api/src/__tests__/auth/
- **Test Standards:** Unit tests for authorizer logic, integration tests for Cognito
- **Testing Frameworks:** Vitest with AWS SDK mocking
- **Specific Requirements:**
  - Test JWT token validation with valid/invalid/expired tokens
  - Test user group assignment and role determination  
  - Test API Gateway integration with authorization
  - Test CORS and security headers
  - Integration test with actual Cognito User Pool

### Testing
- **Test Location:** apps/api/src/__tests__/auth/ and apps/web/src/app/core/services/__tests__/
- **Test Standards:** Unit tests for auth services, integration tests for Cognito flow
- **Testing Frameworks:** 
  - Backend: Vitest with AWS SDK mocking
  - Frontend: Angular Testing Utilities with auth service testing
- **Specific Requirements:**
  - Test complete authentication flow from Angular to Lambda
  - Test role-based access control and route protection
  - Test JWT token handling and refresh logic
  - Test error scenarios (invalid credentials, network failures)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-31

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Implementation demonstrates solid architecture with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and robust JWT token validation. The authentication flow is well-structured with appropriate middleware patterns. Test coverage is comprehensive with 9 test scenarios covering all authentication paths.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: apps/api/src/__tests__/auth/authorizer.test.ts
  - **Change**: Fixed test mocking implementation for proper Vitest integration
  - **Why**: Original mocking pattern caused reference errors preventing tests from running
  - **How**: Restructured module mocking to define mock functions before module imports, ensuring proper test execution

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows TypeScript and naming conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Proper separation of handlers, middleware, and utilities
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage with unit tests
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed authentication test mocking issues (apps/api/src/__tests__/auth/authorizer.test.ts)
- [x] Verified JWT token validation implementation (apps/api/src/handlers/auth/authorizer.ts)  
- [x] Validated error handling and logging patterns (apps/api/src/middleware/)
- [ ] Consider moving test user passwords to environment variables for better security
- [ ] Configure environment-specific CORS origins instead of wildcard for production

### Security Review

**Strengths**: JWT validation with proper signature verification, token expiration checks, secure error handling without information leakage, production environment protection for test operations.

**Concerns**: Hardcoded test user passwords in source code (medium severity), wildcard CORS configuration may not be appropriate for production (medium severity).

### Performance Considerations

**Strengths**: Structured logging with request correlation, proper error handling middleware, database connection reuse pattern. No performance bottlenecks identified.

### Files Modified During Review

- apps/api/src/__tests__/auth/authorizer.test.ts (fixed test mocking implementation)

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.4-authentication-system-cognito.yml

### Recommended Status

[✓ Ready for Done] - Implementation is functionally complete and well-tested. The identified security concerns are medium-severity and can be addressed in future iterations without blocking deployment.
