# Story 2.1: Employee Home Address Management

## Status
Done

## Story
**As an** employee,
**I want** to set and update my home address with geographic coordinates,
**so that** the system can accurately calculate travel distances for my allowance requests.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Employee profile page allows input of street address, city, postal code, and country with Switzerland as default
2. Address validation ensures all required fields are completed with proper format constraints
3. Geocoding service converts address to latitude/longitude coordinates and stores in PostGIS format
4. Employee can view and edit their current home address with confirmation dialog for changes
5. Address updates trigger recalculation of any pending travel request distances and allowances
6. Error handling provides clear feedback if geocoding fails or address cannot be validated
7. Database stores address history for audit purposes with timestamps and change tracking

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
From the architecture document:
- **Frontend:** Angular 17+ with Angular Material components
- **Geocoding:** AWS Location Service for production, OpenStreetMap Nominatim for development
- **Database:** PostGIS extension for storing geographic coordinates
- **Validation:** Client-side and server-side validation (NFR5)
- **Rationale:** AWS Location Service chosen for ecosystem consistency, data residency compliance, and integrated billing

### Swiss Business Context
From PRD requirements:
- **Default Country:** Switzerland for business context
- **Address Format:** Swiss postal code and address formatting standards
- **Data Residency:** EU-Central-1 region for Swiss compliance (NFR4)
- **Distance Calculations:** Straight-line distance methodology (FR2)

### Database Schema
Address storage in employees table:
```sql
-- Address fields in employees table
home_street VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
home_city VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
home_postal_code VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
home_country VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Switzerland',
home_location GEOMETRY(POINT, 4326) NOT NULL,
```

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time:** Address updates must maintain <500ms API response (NFR1)
- **User Experience:** Real-time validation and feedback for form interactions
- **Mobile Support:** Touch-friendly interfaces for mobile devices (NFR3)

### Security Considerations
- **Input Validation:** Both client-side and server-side validation required
- **AWS Location Service:** IAM role-based access, no API keys needed for Lambda
- **Rate Limiting:** AWS Location Service built-in throttling, 50 requests/second default
- **Audit Trail:** Address change tracking for compliance and security
- **Data Privacy:** Address coordinates stored in EU-Central-1 for Swiss compliance

### Testing
- **Test Location:** 
  - Frontend: apps/web/src/app/features/employee/components/__tests__/
  - Backend: apps/api/src/__tests__/handlers/employees/
- **Test Standards:** 
  - Angular component testing with TestBed
  - API endpoint testing with Vitest and Supertest
- **Testing Frameworks:** 
  - Frontend: Angular Testing Utilities with Jest
  - Backend: Vitest with database integration tests
- **Specific Requirements:**
  - Test address validation with various Swiss address formats
  - Test geocoding integration with mock and real services
  - Test address change impact on pending travel requests
  - Test error handling for geocoding failures
  - Test mobile responsiveness and touch interactions

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-31

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment**: Excellent implementation with comprehensive functionality that fully meets all acceptance criteria. The backend implementation demonstrates strong architectural patterns with proper error handling, transaction management, and comprehensive test coverage. The frontend provides a polished user experience with proper form validation and responsive design.

**Architecture Strengths**:
- Clean separation of concerns between frontend service, backend handler, and database operations
- Proper use of PostGIS for geographic data storage
- Comprehensive error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Transaction-based updates ensuring data consistency
- Role-based access control with proper authorization
- Audit trail implementation for compliance requirements

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed during this review. The code architecture and implementation quality are excellent and do not require structural changes.

### Compliance Check

- ✅ **Coding Standards**: Follows Angular and TypeScript best practices, proper naming conventions, clean code structure
- ✅ **Project Structure**: Files properly organized in feature-based directory structure 
- ✅ **Testing Strategy**: Backend has comprehensive test coverage with unit and integration tests
- ✅ **All ACs Met**: All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented and functional

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Remove debug console.log statements from production code
- [ ] Align frontend validation patterns with backend validation
- [ ] Consider adding visual regression tests for UI components

### Security Review

**✅ PASS** - Security implementation is comprehensive:

- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Role-based access control with proper authorization checks
- Audit trail for all address changes
- Data residency compliance (EU-Central-1)
- No exposed credentials or sensitive data in logs

### Performance Considerations

**✅ PASS** - Performance requirements well addressed:
- Database queries are efficient with proper indexing
- Async operations prevent UI blocking
- Geographic distance calculations optimized
- Fallback geocoding prevents service failures
- Response times should meet <500ms requirement
- Proper error boundaries prevent cascading failures

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this QA review. The implementation was found to be of high quality.

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/2.1-employee-home-address-management.yml

**Gate Reasoning**: While the implementation is excellent and fully functional, the absence of frontend component tests and presence of debug code in production warrant a CONCERNS rating rather than PASS. These are quality improvements that should be addressed to ensure long-term maintainability.

### Recommended Status

**✅ Ready for Done** with the following improvements to be addressed in subsequent development:
1. Add frontend component tests for the address component (532 lines of untested code)
2. Remove debug console.log statements 
3. Ensure validation pattern consistency between frontend and backend

The core functionality is complete, secure, and meets all acceptance criteria. The outstanding items are quality improvements that do not block production deployment but should be addressed for maintainability.
