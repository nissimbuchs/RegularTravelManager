# Story 2.1: Employee Home Address Management

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As an** employee,
**I want** to set and update my home address with geographic coordinates,
**so that** the system can accurately calculate travel distances for my allowance requests.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Employee profile page allows input of street address, city, postal code, and country with Switzerland as default
2. Address validation ensures all required fields are completed with proper format constraints
3. Geocoding service converts address to latitude/longitude coordinates and stores in PostGIS format
4. Employee can view and edit their current home address with confirmation dialog for changes
5. Address updates trigger recalculation of any pending travel request distances and allowances
6. Error handling provides clear feedback if geocoding fails or address cannot be validated
7. Database stores address history for audit purposes with timestamps and change tracking

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
From the architecture document:
- **Frontend:** Angular 17+ with Angular Material components
- **Geocoding:** AWS Location Service for production, OpenStreetMap Nominatim for development
- **Database:** PostGIS extension for storing geographic coordinates
- **Validation:** Client-side and server-side validation (NFR5)
- **Rationale:** AWS Location Service chosen for ecosystem consistency, data residency compliance, and integrated billing

### Swiss Business Context
From PRD requirements:
- **Default Country:** Switzerland for business context
- **Address Format:** Swiss postal code and address formatting standards
- **Data Residency:** EU-Central-1 region for Swiss compliance (NFR4)
- **Distance Calculations:** Straight-line distance methodology (FR2)

### Database Schema
Address storage in employees table:
```sql
-- Address fields in employees table
home_street VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
home_city VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
home_postal_code VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
home_country VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Switzerland',
home_location GEOMETRY(POINT, 4326) NOT NULL,
```

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time:** Address updates must maintain <500ms API response (NFR1)
- **User Experience:** Real-time validation and feedback for form interactions
- **Mobile Support:** Touch-friendly interfaces for mobile devices (NFR3)

### Security Considerations
- **Input Validation:** Both client-side and server-side validation required
- **AWS Location Service:** IAM role-based access, no API keys needed for Lambda
- **Rate Limiting:** AWS Location Service built-in throttling, 50 requests/second default
- **Audit Trail:** Address change tracking for compliance and security
- **Data Privacy:** Address coordinates stored in EU-Central-1 for Swiss compliance

### Testing
- **Test Location:** 
  - Frontend: apps/web/src/app/features/employee/components/__tests__/
  - Backend: apps/api/src/__tests__/handlers/employees/
- **Test Standards:** 
  - Angular component testing with TestBed
  - API endpoint testing with Vitest and Supertest
- **Testing Frameworks:** 
  - Frontend: Angular Testing Utilities with Jest
  - Backend: Vitest with database integration tests
- **Specific Requirements:**
  - Test address validation with various Swiss address formats
  - Test geocoding integration with mock and real services
  - Test address change impact on pending travel requests
  - Test error handling for geocoding failures
  - Test mobile responsiveness and touch interactions
