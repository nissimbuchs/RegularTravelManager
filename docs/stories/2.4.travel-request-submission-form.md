# Story 2.4: Travel Request Submission Form

## Status
Done

## Story
**As an** employee,
**I want** to submit travel allowance requests with immediate calculation feedback,
**so that** I can see the daily and weekly allowance amounts before submitting my request.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Request form provides dropdowns for project selection, subproject selection, and manager selection from all available managers
2. Days per week input accepts values 1-7 with validation and error messaging for invalid ranges
3. Justification text area requires minimum 10 characters with counter display and maximum 500 character limit
4. Real-time calculation display shows distance, daily allowance, and weekly total as user completes form fields
5. Form validation prevents submission with missing required fields or invalid data
6. Successful submission displays confirmation with request ID and calculated allowance summary
7. Form auto-saves draft data to prevent loss during session interruptions

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
From the architecture document:
- **Frontend:** Angular 17+ with Angular Material form components
- **Real-time Calculation:** API calls to calculation engine for immediate feedback
- **Form Handling:** Angular Reactive Forms with validation
- **State Management:** NgRx for form state and draft management

### UX Requirements
From UX specifications:
- **Forms-first Workflow:** Primary interaction is structured form submission
- **Real-time Validation:** Immediate feedback and calculation preview
- **Mobile Support:** Touch-friendly interfaces for mobile submission (NFR3)
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Complex information revealed appropriately

### Business Requirements
From PRD requirements:
- **Request Workflow:** Employee submits requests with project, manager, justification (FR1)
- **Calculation Preview:** Immediate feedback on calculated allowances (FR3)
- **Data Validation:** Client-side and server-side validation (NFR5)
- **User Experience:** Swiss business professional interface standards

### Form Data Model
Request submission form data:
```typescript
interface TravelRequestFormData {
  projectId: string;
  subProjectId: string;
  managerId: string;
  daysPerWeek: number; // 1-7
  justification: string; // 10-500 chars
}

interface CalculationPreview {
  distance: number; // km, 3 decimal places
  dailyAllowance: number; // CHF, 2 decimal places
  weeklyAllowance: number; // CHF, 2 decimal places
}
```

### Real-time Calculation Flow
- User selects project → Load subprojects
- User selects subproject + has home address → Calculate distance
- Distance + cost rate → Calculate daily allowance
- Daily allowance + days per week → Calculate weekly total

### Testing
- **Test Location:** 
  - Frontend: apps/web/src/app/features/employee/components/__tests__/
  - Integration: apps/web/src/app/__tests__/integration/
- **Test Standards:** 
  - Angular component testing with form interaction
  - Real-time calculation testing with mock services
- **Testing Frameworks:** 
  - Frontend: Angular Testing Utilities with Jest
  - E2E: Playwright for complete form submission flow
- **Specific Requirements:**
  - Test form validation with various input combinations
  - Test real-time calculation updates
  - Test auto-save and draft restoration functionality
  - Test mobile touch interactions and responsive behavior
  - Test error handling and recovery scenarios

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-31

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Implementation Quality: Good with Production Readiness Concerns**

The travel request submission form implementation demonstrates solid technical execution with proper Angular patterns, comprehensive validation, and good user experience features. The reactive form approach is well-implemented with appropriate debounced calculations and draft persistence. However, several production readiness issues need addressing before release.

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: travel-request-form.component.ts
- **Change**: Removed debug console.log statements from ngOnInit and loadSubprojects methods
- **Why**: Debug logging statements should not be present in production code as they can expose sensitive information and clutter browser console
- **How**: Cleaned up development debugging while preserving error logging for legitimate error handling

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ **Passes** - Proper TypeScript patterns, service layer usage, and naming conventions followed
- Project Structure: ✓ **Passes** - Angular 17+ structure with standalone components and proper imports
- Testing Strategy: ⚠️ **Concerns** - Good unit test coverage but missing integration tests for complex reactive flows
- All ACs Met: ✓ **Passes** - All 7 acceptance criteria are functionally implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist

**Addressed during review:**
- [x] Removed debug console.log statements from production code (travel-request-form.component.ts)
- [x] Cleaned up development debugging while preserving error handling

**Remaining items for dev to address:**
- [ ] Fix form data model mismatch - story spec indicates `managerId` but implementation uses `managerName`
- [ ] Add integration tests for debounced calculation preview updates and reactive form chains
- [ ] Enhance error handling with more specific user-friendly messages for different failure scenarios
- [ ] Consider removing `clearProblemDraft` method comment about "can be removed in production"

### Security Review

**Status: PASS**
- Client-side validation is appropriate and properly implemented
- LocalStorage usage for draft persistence is acceptable for non-sensitive form data
- No security vulnerabilities identified in form handling or data transmission
- Service layer properly abstracts API communications

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS**
- Debounced calculations (300ms) prevent excessive API calls during user input
- Proper loading states implemented for async operations
- Form subscriptions are properly managed with cleanup in ngOnDestroy
- RxJS operators used efficiently for reactive form handling

### Files Modified During Review

**Initial QA cleanup:**
- `apps/web/src/app/features/employee/components/travel-request-form.component.ts` - Removed debug logging statements

**Medium priority fixes:**
- `packages/shared/src/types/api.ts` - Updated TravelRequestFormData to use managerId instead of managerName
- `apps/web/src/app/features/employee/components/travel-request-form.component.ts` - Updated form to use managerId field
- `apps/web/src/app/features/employee/components/travel-request-form.component.html` - Updated template to use managerId field
- `apps/web/src/app/features/employee/services/travel-request.service.ts` - Updated service to handle managerId
- `apps/web/src/app/features/employee/components/__tests__/travel-request-form.component.spec.ts` - Added integration tests and updated existing tests for managerId
- `apps/web/src/app/features/employee/components/travel-request-form.component.ts` - Enhanced error handling with specific user messages

*Dev should update File List to reflect all changes*

### Validation Review - 2025-09-03

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

**Status: VALIDATED ✅**

Conducted validation review of the travel request submission form implementation following completion of Story 2.4B backend integration. 

**Key Validation Points:**
- ✅ **Backend Integration**: Form properly includes `manager_id` field in submission data, fully compatible with Story 2.4B backend implementation
- ✅ **Manager Selection**: Dropdown functionality correctly sends selected manager's ID to backend API endpoint
- ✅ **Form Data Model**: `TravelRequestFormData` interface properly includes `managerId` field matching story specification
- ✅ **Service Layer**: `TravelRequestService.submitRequest()` correctly maps frontend form data to backend API format
- ✅ **Calculation Preview**: Real-time calculation functionality remains intact and functional
- ✅ **Validation**: All form validation rules properly implemented and working

**Implementation Quality:**
The travel request form implementation remains in excellent condition with proper integration to the corrected backend logic. All acceptance criteria continue to be met, and the form successfully enables employees to select any available manager for travel request approval.

**Recommendation:** 
Story remains **Ready for Done** with continued PASS gate status.
