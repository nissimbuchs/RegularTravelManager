# Story 2.4: Travel Request Submission Form

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As an** employee,
**I want** to submit travel allowance requests with immediate calculation feedback,
**so that** I can see the daily and weekly allowance amounts before submitting my request.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Request form provides dropdowns for project selection, subproject selection, and manager name input field
2. Days per week input accepts values 1-7 with validation and error messaging for invalid ranges
3. Justification text area requires minimum 10 characters with counter display and maximum 500 character limit
4. Real-time calculation display shows distance, daily allowance, and weekly total as user completes form fields
5. Form validation prevents submission with missing required fields or invalid data
6. Successful submission displays confirmation with request ID and calculated allowance summary
7. Form auto-saves draft data to prevent loss during session interruptions

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
From the architecture document:
- **Frontend:** Angular 17+ with Angular Material form components
- **Real-time Calculation:** API calls to calculation engine for immediate feedback
- **Form Handling:** Angular Reactive Forms with validation
- **State Management:** NgRx for form state and draft management

### UX Requirements
From UX specifications:
- **Forms-first Workflow:** Primary interaction is structured form submission
- **Real-time Validation:** Immediate feedback and calculation preview
- **Mobile Support:** Touch-friendly interfaces for mobile submission (NFR3)
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Complex information revealed appropriately

### Business Requirements
From PRD requirements:
- **Request Workflow:** Employee submits requests with project, manager, justification (FR1)
- **Calculation Preview:** Immediate feedback on calculated allowances (FR3)
- **Data Validation:** Client-side and server-side validation (NFR5)
- **User Experience:** Swiss business professional interface standards

### Form Data Model
Request submission form data:
```typescript
interface TravelRequestFormData {
  projectId: string;
  subProjectId: string;
  managerId: string;
  daysPerWeek: number; // 1-7
  justification: string; // 10-500 chars
}

interface CalculationPreview {
  distance: number; // km, 3 decimal places
  dailyAllowance: number; // CHF, 2 decimal places
  weeklyAllowance: number; // CHF, 2 decimal places
}
```

### Real-time Calculation Flow
- User selects project → Load subprojects
- User selects subproject + has home address → Calculate distance
- Distance + cost rate → Calculate daily allowance
- Daily allowance + days per week → Calculate weekly total

### Testing
- **Test Location:** 
  - Frontend: apps/web/src/app/features/employee/components/__tests__/
  - Integration: apps/web/src/app/__tests__/integration/
- **Test Standards:** 
  - Angular component testing with form interaction
  - Real-time calculation testing with mock services
- **Testing Frameworks:** 
  - Frontend: Angular Testing Utilities with Jest
  - E2E: Playwright for complete form submission flow
- **Specific Requirements:**
  - Test form validation with various input combinations
  - Test real-time calculation updates
  - Test auto-save and draft restoration functionality
  - Test mobile touch interactions and responsive behavior
  - Test error handling and recovery scenarios
