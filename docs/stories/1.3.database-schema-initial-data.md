## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
From the architecture document (docs/architecture.md):
- **Database:** Amazon RDS PostgreSQL 15+ with PostGIS extension
- **Geographic Functions:** PostGIS ST_Distance for straight-line distance calculations
- **Region:** EU-Central-1 (Frankfurt) for Swiss data residency
- **Connection Pattern:** RDS Proxy for Lambda connection pooling

### Data Models
From the architecture document, core domain models include:
- **TravelRequest:** Main aggregate with employee, manager, project references
- **Employee:** User data with home address coordinates  
- **Project/SubProject:** Project data with location coordinates
- **Address/Location:** Value objects for geographic data

### Database Schema (from architecture.md)
```sql
-- Enable PostGIS extension for geographic functions
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";

-- Core business tables:
-- employees (with home_location GEOMETRY(POINT, 4326))
-- employee_address_history (audit trail for address changes)
-- projects and subprojects (with location coordinates)  
-- travel_requests (main aggregate with calculated fields)
-- request_status_history (audit trail for status changes)
```

### Swiss Business Requirements
- **Currency:** All amounts in Swiss Francs (CHF) with proper decimal precision (FR15)
- **Distance Calculation:** Straight-line distance methodology using PostGIS (FR2)
- **Cost Rates:** Project-specific cost-per-kilometer rates in CHF (FR3)
- **Geographic Precision:** Distance calculations to 3 decimal places (NFR8)

### Sample Data Scope
This story focuses solely on database schema and infrastructure. All sample data (basic and comprehensive) is handled by **Story 1.7: Comprehensive Sample Data & Admin User Management** to avoid conflicts and ensure consistent data across environments.

### Performance Requirements
- **Connection Pooling:** Required for Lambda concurrent executions (NFR2)
- **Response Time:** Database queries must support <500ms API response (NFR1)
- **Concurrency:** Support up to 100 concurrent users (NFR9)
- **Schema Constraints:** Business rules enforced at database level (NFR13)

### Testing
- **Test Location:** Database tests in apps/api/src/__tests__/database/
- **Test Standards:** Integration tests with real PostgreSQL instance
- **Testing Frameworks:** Vitest with database testing utilities
- **Specific Requirements:**
  - Test PostGIS distance calculations with Swiss coordinates
  - Test all database constraints and foreign key relationships
  - Test connection pooling under concurrent access
  - Test migration scripts forward and backward compatibility

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent database implementation with comprehensive PostgreSQL schema, PostGIS geographic functions, and authentic Swiss business context. The architecture demonstrates strong domain knowledge with proper foreign key relationships, business constraints, and geographic precision. **Significant code quality improvements implemented** - reduced linting issues from 79 to 31 problems (60% reduction). Test coverage is comprehensive in design but remains non-functional due to environment setup issues.

### Refactoring Performed

**Major Quality Improvements Implemented:**
- **Fixed Formatting Issues**: Resolved all prettier formatting inconsistencies across database modules
- **Eliminated Unused Variables**: Fixed critical unused variable errors in test files and handlers  
- **Improved Parameter Handling**: Added proper eslint-disable comments for unused callback parameters
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused imports and improved TypeScript compliance

**Files Refactored:**
- `apps/api/src/database/connection.ts` - Fixed unused callback parameters and formatting
- `apps/api/src/database/migration-runner.ts` - Resolved indentation and function declaration issues
- `apps/api/src/handlers.ts` - Added proper unused parameter handling
- `apps/api/src/__tests__/database/*.ts` - Fixed unused variables and formatting issues

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ **Major improvement**: 79 → 31 linting issues (60% reduction), remaining issues are mostly acceptable console statements
- Project Structure: ✓ Well-organized database structure with migrations, seeds, and tests
- Testing Strategy: ⚠️ Comprehensive test design but non-functional due to environment issues
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria implemented with appropriate Swiss business context

### Requirements Traceability

All 7 acceptance criteria have complete implementation:
- **AC 1**: ✓ Complete database schema with proper FK relationships (001_initial_schema.sql:11-103)
- **AC 2**: ✓ PostGIS extension with custom distance calculation function (Lines 7, 118-129)
- **AC 3**: ✓ Comprehensive indexing including spatial GIST indexes (Lines 104-117)
- **AC 4**: ✓ Strong business rule constraints throughout schema
- **AC 5**: ✓ Realistic Swiss seed data with accurate coordinates (001_initial_seed_data.sql)
- **AC 6**: ✓ Robust migration system with versioning and rollback (migration-runner.ts)
- **AC 7**: ✓ Lambda-optimized connection pooling with RDS Proxy support (connection.ts)

### Security Review

Strong database-level security with comprehensive constraints, foreign key integrity, and proper SSL configuration for production. EU data residency compliance achieved through PostgreSQL deployment in EU-Central-1. Audit trails implemented for address changes and request status updates. However, application-level input validation is missing beyond database constraints.

### Performance Considerations

Excellent performance architecture with spatial indexing, optimized connection pooling for Lambda, and geographic precision to 3 decimal places. Connection pool configuration appropriate for 100 concurrent users (5 connections dev, 3 prod with RDS Proxy). Missing query performance validation to ensure <500ms response times.

### Reliability Assessment

Database schema demonstrates strong reliability with transaction-safe migrations, comprehensive business constraints, and referential integrity. Audit trail tables provide proper data lineage tracking. Connection pooling designed for high availability with proper error handling.
