- **Scalability:** Supports bulk operations on large user bases (1000+ users)
- **Compliance:** Comprehensive audit trails meet Swiss business compliance requirements
- **Performance:** Asynchronous processing for long-running bulk operations

### Existing System Integration
From Story 5.3 and current implementation:
- **User Management API:** Extends existing user management endpoints with bulk capabilities
- **Authentication System:** Leverages existing admin role validation and JWT tokens
- **Database Schema:** Adds advanced tables to existing user management schema
- **Email System:** Uses existing SES configuration for bulk operation notifications

### Security Requirements
From PRD non-functional requirements:
- **Admin Authorization:** Enhanced role validation for advanced admin operations (NFR14)
- **Data Encryption:** All advanced operations via HTTPS/TLS (NFR6)
- **Comprehensive Audit:** Full audit trail for all administrative actions (NFR12)
- **Bulk Operation Security:** Validation and authorization for mass user changes (NFR7)

  registrationTrends: RegistrationTrend[];
  departmentBreakdown: DepartmentStats[];
  managerHierarchy: ManagerHierarchyStats;
}
```

  - User activity monitoring with real-time updates
  - Report generation with various formats and filters
  - Audit trail queries with large datasets and complex searches
- **Specific Requirements:**
  - Test bulk operations with 1000+ user datasets
  - Test activity monitoring with real-time data streams
