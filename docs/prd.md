# RegularTravelManager Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable employees to submit travel allowance requests efficiently with automatic distance and cost calculations
- Provide managers with streamlined approval workflows including bulk operations and employee context
- Ensure accurate Swiss Franc-based allowance calculations using straight-line distance methodology
- Deliver transparent status tracking for both employees and managers throughout the request lifecycle
- Create a secure, scalable system that integrates with existing Swiss business practices and compliance requirements

### Background Context

RegularTravelManager addresses the manual, error-prone process of calculating and managing employee travel allowances in Swiss businesses. Currently, employees and managers must manually calculate distances between home addresses and project locations, apply varying cost-per-kilometer rates by project, and track approval workflows through disconnected systems.

The solution leverages modern web technologies and AWS infrastructure to automate distance calculations using PostGIS geographic functions, provide real-time status updates, and streamline the approval process. The system is designed specifically for Swiss business contexts, supporting CHF currency calculations and regulatory compliance requirements while maintaining user-friendly interfaces for both employees and managers.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

RegularTravelManager prioritizes **simplicity and efficiency** for Swiss business users managing travel allowances. The interface follows a **task-oriented design** where employees can quickly submit requests with immediate feedback on calculated allowances, while managers can efficiently review and process requests with contextual employee information. The design emphasizes **transparency and trust** through clear status indicators, calculation breakdowns, and audit trails, supporting the formal business processes typical in Swiss corporate environments.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Forms-first workflow**: Primary interactions center on structured form submission with real-time validation and calculation feedback
- **Dashboard-centric navigation**: Both employee and manager experiences use role-specific dashboards as primary navigation hubs
- **Status-driven visual hierarchy**: Color-coded status indicators (pending/approved/rejected) provide immediate visual context
- **Contextual actions**: Actions appear contextually based on user role and item status (approve/reject for managers, withdraw for employees)
- **Progressive disclosure**: Complex information (distance calculations, audit trails) revealed through expandable sections or detail views

### Core Screens and Views

- **Employee Dashboard**: Personal request overview with status tracking and quick access to new request submission
- **New Travel Request Form**: Guided form with project selection, manager assignment, and real-time allowance calculation preview
- **Request Detail View**: Complete request information with calculation breakdown, status history, and available actions
- **Manager Approval Dashboard**: Pending requests queue with employee context, bulk selection, and filtering capabilities
- **Manager Request Review**: Individual request assessment with employee details, calculation validation, and approval controls
- **Employee Search Interface**: Manager tool for finding employees and viewing their request history
- **Login/Authentication**: Simple authentication flow with role-based redirection

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance ensuring accessibility for Swiss business users including:
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labels and semantic markup
- Color contrast ratios meeting AA standards for status indicators and text
- Focus indicators clearly visible for form navigation
- Alternative text for calculation breakdowns and status icons

### Branding

**Swiss Business Professional**: Clean, minimalist design reflecting Swiss business culture with emphasis on precision, reliability, and efficiency. Color palette uses professional blues and grays with Swiss Franc currency formatting throughout. Typography emphasizes readability and formality appropriate for corporate expense management. Visual hierarchy supports quick decision-making with clear data presentation and action buttons.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

**Primary**: Desktop browser experience optimized for manager workflows with detailed data tables and bulk operations
**Secondary**: Mobile responsive design for employees submitting requests on-the-go with touch-friendly form controls
**Tablet**: Intermediate experience supporting both employee and manager use cases with adaptive layout
All platforms maintain consistent functionality with responsive breakpoints at 768px (tablet) and 1024px (desktop)

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

**Single repository with npm workspaces** containing all applications and shared packages. This supports TypeScript type sharing between frontend and backend while maintaining DDD domain boundaries through workspace organization. The monorepo enables consistent tooling, shared configurations, and streamlined CI/CD pipelines across all components.

### Service Architecture

**AWS Serverless Functions within a Monorepo** using Lambda + API Gateway + RDS PostgreSQL architecture. Each domain service (travel-allowance, employee-management, project-management) maps to dedicated Lambda functions while sharing common infrastructure and data models. This approach provides auto-scaling, pay-per-request pricing, and minimal operational overhead while supporting Domain-Driven Design principles.

### Testing Requirements

**Full Testing Pyramid** implementation including:
- **Unit tests**: Domain logic, business rules, and component functionality using Vitest
- **Integration tests**: API endpoints, database operations, and service interactions
- **End-to-end tests**: Complete user workflows using Playwright for critical business processes
