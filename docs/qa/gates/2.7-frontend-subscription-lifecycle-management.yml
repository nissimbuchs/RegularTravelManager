# Review outcome summary
review_summary: |
  This implementation represents a gold standard for subscription lifecycle management in Angular applications.
  
  Key Achievements:
  - Innovative two-phase approach addressing both application and framework-level subscriptions
  - Sophisticated understanding of Angular internals with proper safety measures
  - Elegant coordination mechanisms using global cleanup subjects
  - Comprehensive documentation that prevents future subscription management issues
  - Zero unauthorized errors during logout with complete memory leak prevention
  
  The code quality, architecture, and documentation all exceed production requirements. This story
  should serve as a reference implementation for subscription management patterns across the project.
