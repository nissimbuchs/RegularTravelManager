# Generated by Quinn, Test Architect & Quality Advisor

gate:
  story: "5.2"
  title: "User Profile Management"
  decision: "CONCERNS"
  risk_level: "MEDIUM-HIGH"
  review_date: "2025-01-19"
  reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

summary: |
  Implementation demonstrates good architectural patterns and follows established conventions.
  However, critical gaps in test coverage and missing security features prevent PASS rating.
  The partial implementation creates risk for production deployment.

strengths:
  - architectural_consistency: "Follows project dialog pattern consistently"
  - security_basics: "Admin restrictions and audit trail properly implemented"
  - data_integrity: "Transaction management with proper rollback"
  - code_quality: "Clean TypeScript with proper error handling"

critical_concerns:
  test_coverage:
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    finding: "Zero test files for profile functionality"
    impact: "Cannot verify functionality or security scenarios"

  incomplete_features:
    severity: "HIGH"
    missing:
      - "Password change functionality (AC #2)"
      - "Email verification flow (AC #5)"
      - "Security confirmation for critical changes (AC #8)"
    impact: "Core security features unavailable"

  validation_gaps:
    severity: "MEDIUM"
    issues:
      - "Phone validation pattern mismatch frontend/backend"
      - "Missing notification preferences validation"
      - "No XSS protection on inputs"

requirements_coverage:
  total_acs: 8
  implemented: 5
  partial: 1
  missing: 3
  coverage_percentage: 62.5

blocking_issues:
  - "No test coverage (required: 80% minimum)"
  - "Missing password change functionality"
  - "Missing email verification system"
  - "Validation pattern inconsistencies"

recommendations:
  must_fix:
    - "Add comprehensive test suite with 80% coverage"
    - "Implement password change with Cognito integration"
    - "Add input sanitization for security"
    - "Fix validation pattern consistency"

  should_fix:
    - "Complete email verification flow"
    - "Add security confirmation dialogs"
    - "Implement performance monitoring"
    - "Add accessibility attributes"

  nice_to_have:
    - "Progress indicators for operations"
    - "Unsaved changes warning"
    - "Profile picture support"
    - "Activity log viewer"

metrics:
  code_coverage: 0
  code_coverage_required: 80
  cyclomatic_complexity: 8
  complexity_threshold: 10
  technical_debt_days: 3.5
  security_score: 6
  accessibility_score: 5

production_readiness: false
can_deploy_to_dev: true
can_deploy_to_staging: false
can_deploy_to_production: false

next_steps:
  1: "Development team to add test coverage"
  2: "Complete password change implementation"
  3: "Security review after features complete"
  4: "Resubmit for QA review when ready"

notes: |
  The implementation shows good understanding of project patterns and conventions.
  The developer correctly followed the project editing dialog pattern which shows
  attention to consistency. However, the partial implementation and lack of tests
  create significant risk. Recommend completing all security features before
  considering this story done.
